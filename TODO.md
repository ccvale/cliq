# Cliq - Roadmap moving forward

Now that the formal project is over, I can begin to develop this at my own pace. Features that I would like to see included are as follows, and will likely be implemented in some capacity throughout free time.

## Next Steps

- Emoji picker in chat ✅

- GIF keyboard in chat

- Automatic message sorting on message send (obvious one, but was always low priority)

- Cleaning up all of the user calls - find the best time to make calls instead of making calls on random data

- Figure out security, and data privacy things - if this was a real app, this would be key, but I never took the time to learn this aspect

- Profile badges (on profile, choose one in settings) - this is sort of implemented with the verified badge

- Emojis in interests ✅
