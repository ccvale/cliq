# Cliq - making friends has never been easier

## Project Overview

The main concept of **Cliq** (stylistically for Click), was to create a matchmaking web application that serves as an easy way for users to make platonic matches with other users on the platform. Apps such as Tinder and Hinge have proven to be extremely effective, but begs one to ask the question, "If we can use these swipe apps to find quick intimate connections, why not use them to make platonic ones as well?" On Cliq, users are able to create and customize their own profile, and tailor it accordingly to their individual likes and interests. Users will ultimately view a familiarly structured queue of profiles, while belong to other users (within a user specified radius), and can swipe right (to like the profile) or left (to ignore the profile) with the hopes of making matches with users with similar interests. When a match is made, the two users will be allowed to connect and communicate within the app, using a chat feature, where hopefully these matches will cultivate friendships; or in other words, hopefully, they *click*.

## Expected Primary Features

This project is ambitious, and will hopefully have a lot of additional exciting features that realize themselves throughout production. These features cannot be foreseen, but those that will definitely play a key role in Cliq’s primary functionality would be as follows:

- **Complete user profile customization**

  - About section featuring biography, age, location, school/profession, etc. ✅

  - Highlightable interests ✅

  - Ability to upload a profile picture, and potentially one other image for a user to highlight on their profile (differs to dating apps, where multiple photos are required) ✅

- **Chat features**

  - Users will be able to chat with matches if and only if a formal match has occurred

  - Users will have the ability to block (and report, if this project ever scales) their matches if they feel they have crossed a line, or said something explicit/inappropriate

    - They will also be allowed to “un-match” them at any time, instantly removing the ability for them to chat with each other

- **Swiping - the core functionality**

  - Each profile will be represented in the style of a card; this card will have all information from the users profile that they are sharing, and will be visible to other users ✅

  - These cards will exist in a “swipe queue”, where they will show up one at a time, where the user can observe and interact with the card and determine whether or not this user is a potential friend they would like to have ✅

  - Users can swipe right (to like), or swipe left (to discard) on these cards as they wish ✅

  - If both users have swiped right on each other, a match has occurred; both users will be notified, and they can now chat with each other ✅

- **Setting additional filters**

  - Users will be able to filter the users they can see in their swipe queue based on certain criteria, to allow for a better scope of what they are looking for ✅

    - Age (18+ users will not be able to set their lower age bound filter lower than 18, and vice-versa) ✅

    - Distance (maximum distance is filterable in regards to miles away) ✅

- **Authenticating with third party services**

  - Alongside creating an account with a username + password, users can authenticate themselves with popular platforms such as Google, Discord, Twitch, and Tiktok ✅
